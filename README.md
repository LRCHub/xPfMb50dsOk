[00:09.23] I'm not a fan of puppeteers, but I've a nagging fear
[00:12.11] Someone else is pulling at the strings
[00:13.91] Something terrible is going down through the entire town
[00:16.78] Wreaking anarchy, and all it brings
[00:34.28] 
[00:18.50] I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
[00:22.55] I curse the name, the one behind it all
[00:42.05] 
[00:27.25] Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
[00:29.35] And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[00:31.85] Discord, whatever did we do
[00:34.08] To make you take our world away?
[00:36.52] Discord, are we your prey alone
[00:38.73] Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
[00:41.13] Discord, we won't take it anymore
[00:43.18] So take your tyranny away
[00:55.68] 
[01:04.13] I'm fine with changing status quo, but not in letting go
[01:07.00] Now the world is being torn apart
[01:08.82] A terrible catastrophe played by your symphony
[01:11.43] What a terrifying work of art
[01:25.93] 
[01:13.48] I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
[01:17.27] I curse the name, the one behind it all
[01:36.77] 
[01:22.15] Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
[01:24.39] And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[01:26.53] Discord, whatever did we do
[01:28.87] To make you take our world away?
[01:31.26] Discord, are we your prey alone?
[01:33.45] Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
[01:35.83] Discord, we won't take it anymore
[01:38.05] So take your tyranny away
[01:50.55] 
[02:53.54] Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
[02:55.60] And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[02:58.06] Discord, whatever did we do
[03:00.17] To make you take our world away?
[03:02.61] Discord, are we your prey alone
[03:04.88] Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
[03:07.35] Discord, we won't take it anymore
[03:09.31] So take your tyranny away
